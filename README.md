Just fork, clone, and make some changes. Then make a pull request.

The code for the UI is so bad, I'm sorry. I'm just too lazy to optimize it.


## TODO

- [ ] Add support for more games
- [ ] Add support for more cheats
- [ ] Recognize games by alternate names (For example, EoSD's process name can be either 東方紅魔郷.exe or th06.exe. We need to make it so that the program can recognize both)
